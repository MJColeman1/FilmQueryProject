## Film Query Project

### Week 6 Homework for Skill Distillery

#### Description 

The objective of this project is to create an application that allows a user to search a database of films. The user is able to search for films by numerical ID or search keyword and details about that film are returned.

#### How To Run This Project

To run this project, the user is presented with an interactive menu. The user is given the choice to search the film database by a film ID number or search keyword. The film ID search will return results if the user's input matches a film ID number and the keyword search function will return results if the user's input matches either a film title or film description. If a match is found, details returned include the title and description of the film, rating, release year, language, and actors and actresses who performed in the film. If the user's query does not match anything in the database, the user is notified and the menu is displayed again to allow the user to continue searching. The user also has the option to exit the application any time the menu is presented by selecting option 3.

#### Lessons Learned

Utilizing Java to perform queries of a SQL database was a definite lesson learned. The code needed to perform this operation, which includes a driver manager, prepared statements, a URL to connect to the data source, the user name and password to login into the data source, and a result set to execute the query and iterate through various rows of data was all brand new to me. This was also very exciting to learn as you begin to understand how a full-stack application is developed and how the middleware and back end interact with each other.
